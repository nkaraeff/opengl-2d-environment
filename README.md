# Shusha OpenGL Scene Project

This project is a 2D animated scene created using C++ and OpenGL (GLUT).
It represents a stylized environment inspired by Shusha, including buildings, trees, clouds, a road, flowers, and simple animations.

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of a Computer Graphics assignment.
The main goal was to practice drawing primitive shapes (polygons, circles, triangles, lines) and combining them into a complete animated scene.

Different team members contributed to various parts of the scene such as:

* Environment (grass, road, trees)
* Building structure and windows
* Decorative elements
* Cloud animation and interactive controls

## Controls

The project includes basic keyboard interactions:

* P – Start portal animation
* O – Activate portal expansion
* Q – Shrinking animation
* W / E / R / X – Change scene states
* A / S / D – Movement adjustments

## Technologies Used

* C++
* OpenGL
* GLUT

## What I Learned
* How to draw 2D objects using OpenGL primitives
* How to manage animation using timer functions
* How to handle keyboard input
* How different graphical components can be combined into a full scene
